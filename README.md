# Egypt-Agriculture-Heat-Maps
 Every governate in Egypt can produce certain types of crops. We need to create a heat map for a given crop on demand. Develop a system that accepts the list of crops and expected production tonnage of each crop for every gouvernante. Then display on demand the heatmap for a given crop across all Egypt. The system also shows crops heat maps for a given governate, and can compare between two governates. You can use graphics to show the heat map, also instead you can sort the governates from highest production to lowest for a given corp. Create the suitable data structures that allow the system to search efficiently for crops and governates information.
